# webpack-typescript-template

This is a repository made for understanding webpack. I made it into a reusable template To get going with Typescript and SASS/SCSS very quickly for web development.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

The index.ts file is the entry file. Any code in here will be compiled, and possibly minified to es5.
The import for styles.scss is needed for the style loader.

The project is built using
```bash 
npm run build:dev
```
or
```bash
npm run build:prod
```

For development and production build respectively.
